      "2. **Domain Categorization**: The plan mentions categorizing papers into domains like education, healthcare, etc. It would be beneficial to define clear criteria or guidelines for categorization to maintain consistency.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Inclusion of Source URL**: When creating the markdown table, include a column for the source URL of each paper. This will allow users to easily access the full papers for more detailed information.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Abstract Review**: The plan includes reviewing abstracts to ensure relevance. It might be helpful to also consider the introduction or conclusion sections if available, as they often provide a concise summary of the paper's contributions.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Automation and Efficiency**: Consider automating the categorization process using natural language processing techniques to identify keywords related to specific domains, which can save time and improve accuracy.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. **Feedback Loop**: After the initial run, incorporate a feedback loop to refine the search and categorization process based on any missed relevant papers or misclassified domains.\n",
      "\n",

This can be done by checking the metadata provided by the arXiv API.\\n\\n2. **Domain Categorization**: The plan mentions categorizing papers into domains like education, healthcare, etc. It would be beneficial to define clear criteria or guidelines for categorization to maintain consistency.\\n\\n3. **Inclusion of Source URL**: When creating the markdown table, include a column for the source URL of each paper.

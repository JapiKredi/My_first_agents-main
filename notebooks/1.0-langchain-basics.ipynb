They can utilize tools, call APIs, or execute specific functions to achieve the desired outcome.\\n\\n5. **Memory**: Memory components allow the language model to retain context or information across interactions.

When dressed in silly outfits like pajamas, their antics can be even more amusing, especially when they jump around or try to climb on things.\\n\\n5. **Parrots Mimicking Sounds** - Parrots are famous for their ability to mimic human speech and other sounds.
